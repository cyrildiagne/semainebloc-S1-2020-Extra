# eyeTrackingAPIDemo

This is a demo to compare the performance of GazeCloudAPI and WebGazer.

To run the demo:
1. run server with `node server.js`;
2. go to `localhost:5000` on your browser.

If you want to use GazeCloudAPI as a React component, you may find [this repo](https://github.com/bahorn/astonhack2019) very useful. You can simply replace the `App.js` in that repo with `other/App.js` I provided, then you can use GazeCloudAPI as a React component.
